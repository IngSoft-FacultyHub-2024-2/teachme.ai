resuelve el kata

I need more specific information to generate code.

Your prompt "resuelve el kata" (solve the kata) is too vague for me to provide a useful code solution. 

**What I need from you:**
- Which stage do you want me to work on (Stage 1 or Stage 2)?
- What specific programming approach should I use?
- What should the function be called?
- Should I print the results or return them?
- Any specific requirements about code structure?

**Example of a more specific prompt:**
"Write a Python function called fizzbuzz that prints numbers 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with 'Fizz', multiples of 5 with 'Buzz', and multiples of both with 'FizzBuzz'"

Please provide a more detailed prompt so I can generate the code you're looking for!


resuelve el problema de fizzbuzz

I need more specific information to generate code.

Your prompt "resuelve el problema de fizzbuzz" (solve the fizzbuzz problem) is still too general for me to provide a targeted solution.

**To help you craft a better prompt, consider specifying:**
- Do you want Stage 1 (basic rules) or Stage 2 (with digit detection)?
- Should it be a function or a script that runs immediately?
- Do you want the output printed to console or returned as a list?
- Any preferences for the coding approach (if/else chains, string concatenation, etc.)?
- What should happen with the range of numbers (1-100 as specified, or configurable)?

**A more effective prompt might be:**
"Write a Python program that implements the basic FizzBuzz rules for numbers 1 to 100 and prints each result on a new line"

Remember: specific prompts lead to better code generation. Try again with more details about what you want me to implement!


resuelve el problema de dado un numero si es m√∫ltiplo de 3 despliega fizz, si es multiplo de 5 despliega Buzz, si es multiplo de 5 y 3 despliega FizzBuzz, y si no despliega el numero
def check_fizzbuzz(number):
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        return "FizzBuzz"
    elif number % 3 == 0:
        return "Fizz"
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        return "Buzz"
    else:
        return str(number)

# Test with a sample number
test_number = 15

# Test with a few more examples
test_cases = [3, 5, 15, 7]
for num in test_cases:
    print(f"{num}: {check_fizzbuzz(num)}")


Input: 15, Output: FizzBuzz
3: Fizz
5: Buzz
15: FizzBuzz
7: 7

```python
def check_fizzbuzz(number):
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        return "FizzBuzz"
    elif number % 3 == 0:
        return "Fizz"
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        return "Buzz"
    else:
        return str(number)

# Test with a sample number
test_number = 15
result = check_fizzbuzz(test_number)
print(f"Input: {test_number}, Output: {result}")

# Test with a few more examples
test_cases = [3, 5, 15, 7]
for num in test_cases:
    print(f"{num}: {check_fizzbuzz(num)}")
```

**üñ•Ô∏è Code Output:**
```
Input: 15, Output: FizzBuzz
3: Fizz
5: Buzz
15: FizzBuzz
7: 7

## **üìä Evaluation Results**

### **Prompting Skills Evaluation: 5/15 (Basic Level)**

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Clear problem statement with specific rules
- ‚úÖ Explained all conditions (multiples of 3, 5, both)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- ‚ùå Didn't specify if you want a function for single numbers or the full 1-100 range
- ‚ùå No mention of output format or how to use the code
- ‚ùå Missing context about whether this solves the complete kata requirements

**Feedback:** Your prompt clearly explained the logic rules, but consider specifying the scope (single number vs. full range 1-100) and desired output format.

### **Code Quality Evaluation: 4/15 (Basic Level)**

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Correct basic logic implementation
- ‚úÖ Handles all specified conditions properly
- ‚úÖ Code executes without errors

**Areas for Improvement:**
- ‚ùå Only handles single numbers, not the full 1-100 range as per kata requirements
- ‚ùå Basic structure without considering extensibility
- ‚ùå No validation of the complete kata specification

**Next Steps:** Consider prompting for the complete 1-100 range implementation to meet the full kata requirements, or ask for improvements to code structure and readability.

**Ready for your next prompt to improve the solution!**
