## Goal

The goal is to prototype the assistant behavior using Gemini.

## What was done

* The functionality of creating software artifacts to generate the assistant was tested (Gemini Canvas).
* The instructions for generating the assistant and describing its general behavior were based on 27_08_25 Claude artifact experiment.
* The Kata to be used in the experiments was defined (FizzBuzz).
* The Rubric for code and prompt is from the prev experiment.

### Some conclusions:

- Copying text (Kata, Rubrics) is time comsuming for the experimenter.
- The generated app in the first iteration needs improvement for the student.
Improve the assistant user inteface for the student, don't print the whole Kata description and rubric, only key elemenets, use structured text, dont use scrolled text boxes, more iportant assistant chat history should be accesible

## Used prompts
