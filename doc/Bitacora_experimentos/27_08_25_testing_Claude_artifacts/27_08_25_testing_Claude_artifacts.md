# 27_08_25_testing_Claude_artifacts

## Goal

The goal is to prototype the assistant behavior using Claude artifact.

## What was done

* The functionality of creating Claude artifacts to generate the assistant was tested.
* The instructions for generating the assistant and describing its general behavior were improved.
* Rubrics were defined for evaluating code and prompt quality: [Evaluation Criteria](https://claude.ai/share/3aa422dd-11f9-4f94-bd05-02d255ab00b4)
* The Kata to be used in the experiments was defined (FizzBuzz) (link).
  The generated artifact was iterated on by testing its behavior based on happy paths.

### Some conclusions:

- Considering that the assistant’s behavior is based on the prompt generated by the teacher, it may be necessary to define templates for building a kata that includes the elements required for the assistant to behave as expected.
- Since this seems to be resolved through prompts, the path forward may be to build a library of teaching aspects that teachers can use to guide the student’s learning.
