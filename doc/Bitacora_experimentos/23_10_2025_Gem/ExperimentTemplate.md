# 23_10_25_Gemini Gem

## Goal
- Check if a Gem that behaves as the Teaching Assitant can be created and shared


## What was done

- I used the same prompt used for 07_10_25_GTP as Gem instructions.


### Some conclusions:

- The resulting Gem has a correct pedagogical behavior.
- In general the result with the Gemini model is similar to the OpenAI.
- Gems creation, testing and sharing process is similar to GTPs.
