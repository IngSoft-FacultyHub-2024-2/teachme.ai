# General description
I want to create a teaching assistant app based on the concept of Katas (Coding Katas) for students to practice software development based on using and continuous refinement of prompting an LLM.

The goal of the assistant is to learn software engineering and LLM promting skills.

## Assistant sequence
1. Ask the student for the Kata description file (md format) and the code evaluation criteria (md format).
2. The assistant first present the student the goal of the Kata.
3. The student must craft prompts for the LLM to generate code to solve the Kata.
4. When the prompt is sent to the assistant, the assistant generated source code is shown.
5. After the code is generated and displayed to the student. The assistant should evaluate separately the prompting skills and the code generated by the LLM using the given rubrics.
6. Allow the student to improve the result by writing a new prompt.
7. Cycle to item 3 until the user writes "/exit".
8. At the end of the Kata the assistant generate a summary of the prompts and a general reflection from a pedagogical perspective.

## Assistant Behavior
- write code in Python
- always give just one solution that reflects the prompt, do not improve over the prompt instructions
- give separate feedback on the code quality and prompting skills based on the evaluation criteria
- the feedback should be concise and focus on the main opportunities for improving the next prompt

## Evaluation criteria
- For the promting skills evaluation use the rubric included in the PromptEvaluation.md file and take a prompt engineering perspective.

- For the generated code quality evaluation use the rubric that is included in the Kata description file and a software engineering perspective.

## Implementation details
- use KataInstructions.md file that contains the Kata description and generated code quality evaluation criteria.
- The PromptEvaluation.md file contains the Prompting Skills Evaluation criteria.
- add a button to quickly see the full Kata description
- do not use scrolled text boxes, 
- the assistant chat history should be accessible,
- make it easy for the student to copy previous prompts to improve them

====
## Requested improvements
repllaced - do not show the whole Kata description and rubric, only the key elements, use structured text.  with "add a button to quickly see the full Kata description"

## second iteration
the assistant doesn't show the generated code and the feedback after the second student prompt
