# General description
I want to create a teaching assistant app based on the concept of Katas (Coding Katas) for students to practice software development based on using and continuous refinement of prompting an LLM.

The goal of the assistant is to learn software engineering and LLM promting skills.

## Assistant sequence
1. The assistant first present the student the goal of the Kata.
2. The student must craft prompts for the LLM to generate code to solve the Kata.
3. When the promt is sent, the generated source code is shown.
4. After the code is shown the assistant should evaluate separately the prompting skills and the code generated by the LLM.
5. Allow the student to improve the result by writing a new prompt.
6. Cycle to item 3 until the user writes "/exit".
7. At the end of the Kata the assistant generate a summary of the promts and a general reflection from a pedagogical perspective.

## Assistant Behavior
write code in Python
always give just one solution
give separate feedback on the code quality and prompting skills based on the evaluation criteria
the feedback should be concise and focus on the main opportunities for improving the next prompt

## Evaluation criteria
For the promting skills evaluation use the rubric included in the PromptEvaluation.md file and take a promt engineering perspective.

For the generated code quality evaluation use the rubric that is included in the Kata description file and a software engineering perspective.

## Implementation details
For this prototype use FizzBuzz.md file that contains the Kata description and generated code quality evaluation criteria.
The PromtEvaluation.md file cointains the Promting Skills Evaluation criteria.

## Requested improvements

Improve the assistant user inteface for the student, don't print the whole Kata description and rubric, only key elemenets, use structured text, don't use scrolled text boxes, assistant chat history should be accesible.


## second iteration
the assistant doesn't show the generated code and the feedback after the second student prompt
