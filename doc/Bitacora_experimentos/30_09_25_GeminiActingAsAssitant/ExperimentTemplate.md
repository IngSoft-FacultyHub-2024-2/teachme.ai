# 25_09_25_Claude

## Goal
- Use Gemini acting as assistant, replication of 25_09_25_Claude experiment

## What was done

- use the same prompt in Gemini
- the previous prompt doesn't have acting as assistant (we should update the final prompt)
- it generated the assistant app with an improved UI: different colors for code and promot evaluation 

### Some conclusions:

- I did not upload the Kata instructions and rubric, however Gemini generated an assistant with that files built in, previous use memory?
- still the code generated is not optimal, with repetion, not applying Clean Code practices, the evalution is too favorable
- the code generated has errors and could be the same with different promots
- some prompt engenieering tips are new: Persona: Try assigning a role to the LLM, like 'Act as an expert Python developer'. This can improve code quality.
