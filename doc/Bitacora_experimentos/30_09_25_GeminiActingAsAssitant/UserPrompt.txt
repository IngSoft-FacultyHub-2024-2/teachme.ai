Let's begin! The goal is to solve the FizzBuzz challenge. Please provide your first prompt.
generate code to solve the FizzBuzz kata


Generated Code:
# The prompt did not seem to describe the FizzBuzz problem.
# Please provide more details.
"keyword">print("Could not generate code. Please clarify the requirements.")
Code Quality Feedback:
Correctness: The code doesn't solve the problem at all. A clear prompt is needed.
Prompting Skills Feedback:
Clarity/Completeness: The prompt is missing key requirements like 'FizzBuzz', 'Buzz', or the number range.
Persona: Try assigning a role to the LLM, like 'Act as an expert Python developer'. This can improve code quality.
Feel free to refine your previous prompt or write a new one.

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Code Quality Feedback:
Correctness: Good, the logic is correct. Readability: It could be improved by putting the logic into a reusable function.
Prompting Skills Feedback:
Clarity/Completeness: Good! You've included the core requirements of the problem.

Act as an expert Python developer. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz". Don't repeat code, use Clean Code practices.
